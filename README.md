# Calico Robot Tic-Tac-Toe Game
Code for a tic-tac-toe game played against a Calico Myro Robot on a physical board. 
(Written using the 'Myro' library)

A demonstration of how it works can be seen [<ins>here</ins>](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1A90paP4oNe8cw4jwshm9XB-d5-zczpnp/view?usp=sharing). 
> You make a move and then the robot scans the board for your move, and the proceeds to make its move by making a beep at a square on the board. It then returns to the middle of the board and waits until the user indicates that they have made a move through the terminal. Then the process repeats. The robot is by no means 'intelligent'. It will make the generic moves against the user.
